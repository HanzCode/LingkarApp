LingkarApp, Describe the tangle of circles in life

In every trajectory of life, we often feel trapped in a tangled circle. Lingkar App comes as a solution in helping individuals decipher and understand the complexities of their lives.

Lingkar App facilitates users through self-recognition features based on several aspects of life, stress level scores, user condition analysis, life skills education, and direct consultation with experts. 

The targeted users are in their teens, especially those undergoing formal education, because many aspects of life are not touched by every level of formal education in Indonesia, even though this is very important to equip their lives even after they grow up. So hopefully, the solution from Lingkar App can overcome the problems of adolescents that they generally get from friendships and relationships with parents.
